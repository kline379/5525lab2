# Extension 3:
Changing the HMM to be case-insensitive slightly increased the error rate from 5% to 6%. The only words that would be impacted by this are proper nouns that are more commonly used as common nouns, for which there would now be ambiguity and a higher probability for the word being a common noun (and thus being misclassified as such). This may effect performance on the word following the misclassified proper noun (due to the use of the probability of the tag given the previous tag), but the effect is likely less pronounced. The results suggest, however, that this decision does not significantly impact performance, likely because these cases are only a small subset of the observations.
